This project aims to uncover the fascinating journey that takes place behind the scenes when a user types "google.com" in their web browser and presses the Enter key. We will delve into the step-by-step process, shedding light on how the Domain Name System (DNS) converts the human-readable domain name into an IP address, the establishment of a secure connection using HTTPS/SSL, load balancing, and the roles of web servers, application servers, and databases in serving the Google homepage to the user.

By understanding the intricate workings of this fundamental action, we gain valuable insights into the complexities of internet infrastructure and the collaborative efforts that make accessing websites a seamless experience for users worldwide.
